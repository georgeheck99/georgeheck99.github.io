		<p>What good is repairing your credit if you do not change your habits. There is no magic bean that will fix credit, but you can make changes that will put you in a better situation. 
		When the reported incidents drop off your report, if you follow some basic rules, you will be far ahead and never have to worry about bad credit again. 
		According to Egan (2020), you can live frugally and happily and be prepared for tough financial times.<br><br>
